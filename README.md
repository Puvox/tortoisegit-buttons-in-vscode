# TortoiseGit Command Buttons

This VSCODE extension adds buttons in right-click menu (in sidebar and in editor) to execute TortoiseGit commands. 

Note: This is an absolutely ligthweight extension and does not include dependencies or binary files. Only a small plain `.js` file, which only passes commands to TotroiseGit.
(*if you ever had manually removed `%Program Files%\TortoiseGit\bin` from your environment PATH, place it back*)

All possible [tortoise-git commands](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-automation.html) are supported by this extension.
